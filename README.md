Winter Project for the year 2020

Title- Image classification with deployment

Desc.- An image classification model which is able to predict and classify images between 5 different vehicle categories.


Main features implemented in the project - 

-Use of Transfer learning concept to train a CNN model

-Abiltity to process a given image using a Convolutional Neaural Network

-Abitility to classify the images based on predictions of the model .The 5 different Vehicle categories are (Bicycle, Bus, Car, Motobike and Truck).


Tech Stack and concepts used-

Keras, Tensorflow, Transfer learning and other ML concepts


Thought behind the project-

The intial thought was to build a simple image classifier model and train it, from scatrch. However the aim has shifted with progress in project.

Setup steps-
