# WinterProject2020
Winter Project for the year 2020

# Title-
Image classification with deployment


# Desc.-
An image classification model which is able to predict and classify images between 5 different vehicle categories.
Note- Image dataset required for the code to run(provided in setup steps)


# Main features implemented in the project - 

-Use of Transfer learning concept to train a CNN model

-Abiltity to process a given image using a Convolutional Neural Network

-Abitility to classify the images based on predictions of the model .The 5 different Vehicle categories are (Bicycle, Bus, Car, Motorbike and Truck).



# Tech Stack and concepts used-

Keras, Tensorflow, Transfer learning and other ML concepts



# Thought behind the project-

The intial thought was to build a simple image classifier model and train it, from scratch. However the aim has shifted with progress in project.



# Setup steps-

[Image Dataset](www.kaggle.com/dataset/401fc4e8f3faf5a3af5a5aa5a949b312bf7da843c870b0a43521b6ac6644fa84), 
Keras,
Tensorflow


Load the model using the '5VehCatSave2_15.h5' file provided


Change the filepath in the single predictor function to a single image of your choice.
