Winter Project for the year 2020

Title- Image classification using Transfer learning

Desc.- *insert*

Main features implemented in the project - 


-Use of Transfer learning concept to train a CNN model
-Abiltity to process a given image using a Neaural Network
-Abitility to classify the said image in 5 different categories.

Tech Stack and concepts used-
Keras, Tensorflow, Transfer learning and other ML concepts

Thought behind the project-
The intial thought was to build a simple image classifier model and train it, from scatrch. However the aim has shifted with progress in project.
